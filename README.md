# adventure_game
 The code is a simple version of an old-fashioned text-based adventure game. Try it out to get a feeling for how the game works!


## I have learned some critical parts for a working game through this app:

- The game gives players a description of what is happening.
- The game asks players to make a choice and something different happens depending on the choice the player makes.
- The game has conditions for winning and losing.
- When the game is over, it asks if the player wants to play again.
- The game includes some random factors so that it's a little different each time.
